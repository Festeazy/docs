## Before you start

- product groups set up in your master data for your products
- some good recipes!

## Recipes

2. Fill out ingredients
  - Don't worry if you haven't added one to your products before: by pressing tab after filling out the name, a product window will pop up, letting you fill out all the details.
  - Under variable amount you can set amounts that are different from your stock and purchase amounts and units. This will show up instead of the number under Amount.
  - Disable stock fulfillment checking for this ingredient - if checked, the system won't check if you have any of this stocked.
  - Group allows you to have sections in your ingredients list.

If you select a recipe, you can also see all at once what you have in stock, that is, what you can make! The icons on top also let you to consume (that is, remove the given amount from your inventory), put missing products onto your shopping list, as well as edit or delete the recipe itself. When the products have prices attached, the total cost will also be displayed.

## Meal plan

Once you have some recipes set up, you can use the meal plan function to plan out your week comfortably.

1. Navigate to Meal plan in the side menu.

2. You can add a recipe to a day by clicking on the plus; all previously added recipes can be searched for here, and the serving size set.

3. By clicking on the arrow down, you can add a note or a particular product.

If you set prices for your products and thus the recipes, Grocy will display the weekly cost on top. You can also easily add missing items to your shopping list or consume those specified in the recipes.
