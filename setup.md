## Installation

## Setting up users

You can set up your users once you log in with the default admin account (user admin with same password - you should change this for security reasons, of course, by clicking the username and selecting change password). 

Choose the main settings (wrench icon on the top right), and select Manage users. Here you can Add new users, edit and delete existing ones. New users require at minimum a username and a password.

! All users have administrator rights.
