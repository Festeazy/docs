If you select a recipe, you can also see all at once what you have in stock, that is, what you can make! The icons on top also let you to consume (that is, remove the given amount from your inventory), put missing products onto your shopping list, as well as edit or delete the recipe itself. When the products have prices attached, the total cost will also be displayed.
